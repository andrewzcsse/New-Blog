# Game Comments

## Likes
- I like the idea to include several interactive elements like the goombas and the powerup mushrooms
- I like

## Dislikes
- I think the movement is very choppy at some point
    - I especially dislike how the jump move is a teleport and not sprite actually moving up to a certain point
- I dislike how the bar with settings, timer, and leaderboard at the top is not static and can cover up the screen when you scroll
- I dislike how the fun facts cover up such a large portion of the screen

# Hacks

## Timer
- Fixed the timer so that it actually counts up as play time increases
    - Imported GameConttrol.js into GameSteup.js so that the functions for running the timer would actually work

## Lopez fix
- Made the tube at the end of the Lopez level bigger so that the sprite can fit in the tube

# Plans for Next Week

## Fix the movement
- I want to change the jumpin mechanic since right now all sprites teleport from point a to point b when jumping instead of actually travelling
    - Can use tri 1 code for this

# Looking Forward to Team Work

## Team task
- We were assigned leaderboard
    - We need to open some issues as a team so we can set goals
    - Need to assign roles so that we can determine a work structure
