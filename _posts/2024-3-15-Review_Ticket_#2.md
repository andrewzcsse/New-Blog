# Game Comments

## Likes
- I like the idea to include several interactive elements like the goombas and the powerup mushrooms
- I like

## Dislikes
- I think the movement is very choppy at some point
    - I especially dislike how the jump move is a teleport and not sprite actually moving up to a certain point
- I dislike how the bar with settings, timer, and leaderboard at the top is not static and can cover up the screen when you scroll
- I dislike how the fun facts cover up such a large portion of the screen

# Hacks

## Timer
- Fixed the timer so that it actually counts up as play time increases

## Lopez fix
- Made the tube at the end of the Lopez level bigger so that the sprite can fit in the tube
