# How to use the debugger tool

## Inspect Element
- I can use the debugger tool to select any element on my webpage and view its properties
<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/inspect_element.png" >

## Break Points
- I can use break points to direct the code to stop running at any point and ensure the process works up until the break point
    - Navigate to sources
    - Open the appropriate file
    - Set the break point on whichever line I need
<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/break_point.png" >

## Console
- Console is a tri 1 concept that allows me to view errors as I am coding as each output will display in console
    - Refer to link below on how to use console (tri 1 notes)
