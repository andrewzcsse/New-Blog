# Player change
- I want to use the movement from my group's tri 1 project and added the ability for Mario to jump

# Debugging
- I want to fixed the choppy movement on Mario using my team's code from trimester 1

# Seed
- I edited the homepage to better suit my needs with multiple buttons and I changed icons at the bottom of the page for social media links
- I moved over all of the requested projects from my tri 1 repo

# What do I still need to do?
- I need to figure out how I can import themes to the site without getting makefile errors
- I need to begin working on developing a game level with my team
- I need to figure out why platformers 2x isn't working on my repo
